yarnStart my dusty heart

Short and sweet:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

The `dev` script sets `NODE_ENV` to "development", runs the build script in watch mode, and
starts the server with `nodemon`. Build vs server logs are separated by a prefix. If you prefer
to run the server and build processes separately, you can instead do:

```sh
npm run start-dev
```

```sh
npm run build-dev
```

In two separate terminals. The vanilla `npm start` is for production â€” you won't use it in development!

## My anatomy

`/app` has the React/Redux setup. `main.jsx` is the entry point.

`/db` has the Sequelize models and database setup. It'll create the database for you if it doesn't exist,
assuming you're using postgres.

`/server` has the Express server and routes. `start.js` is the entry point.

`/bin` has scripts. (Right now it has *one* script that creates a useful symlink.)

## Conventions

I use `require` and `module.exports` in `.js` files.

I use `import` and `export` in `.jsx` files, unless `require` makes for cleaner code.

I use two spaces, no semi-colons, and trailing commas where possible. I'll
have a linter someday soon.
